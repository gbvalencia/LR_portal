    <h1>LPENHS History</h1>

    <p>
        Las Pinas East National High School – an institution that for years served as a nourishing abode for all kinds of students. This school, together with the people who makes it function, continuously supports and trains young students to grow up and be able to face the challenges of the real world. It started brightening lives since that fateful year of 1986 when the principal of CAA Elementary School, Mr. Zoro Zapanta, decided to widen the scope of his school by welcoming high school students. He started with a humble beginning of two first year sections and a second year section – all of which held classes after the dismissal of the elementary students.

            “If you can dream it, you can become it. If you can believe it, you can have it.” This proved true for our host campus. After the school started enrollment continued increasing until Las Pinas East National High School could no longer accommodate the incoming students. This pushed a decision to make a change. Mrs. Purificacion Aranda, principal of Las Pinas National High School and Mrs. Ma. Luisa Santos, head of the Guidance Services of the same school referred to then municipal mayor, Hon. Rosalino Riguera for an adequate school site. Together, the three of them showed dedication and commitment to their goal of negotiating a school site at Verdant Acres Subd. In Pamplona III. All sacrifices paid off when the Resolution No. 116.89 series of 1989 was adopted by the municipal officials. 4,000 square meters open space located in Verdant Acres Subdivision was renovated to perfectly fit as the site of a new public high school. A 10-classroom, 2-storey building immediately followed marking the beginning of Las Pinas East National High School birth and journey.

            Indeed, making a school function justly and molding it to be able to serve students efficiently are tasks never too easy. After the construction of Las Pinas East National High School pioneer building, facilities and systems deemed necessary were built. The mayor of Las Pinas sanctioned the appropriation of 100,000.00 for the comfort room constructions and another 56,000.00 for the electrical system installations. Then, after the laborious efforts, the fruits of all hard work started showing. Las Pinas East National High School finally opened its doors for all qualified high school students, S.Y. 1990-1991.

            During the direction of Dr. Isabelita  Z. Montesa, which lasted from the year 1990 up to the 4th day of November 1991, the DPWH Building came to existence. It is a 2-storey bldg. with 6 rooms – 1 industrial room and 5 academic classrooms which amounted to 5,131,960.00 from the National funds. Improvements continued as new decision makers moulded Las Pinas East National High School. From the year 1991 – 1993, Ms. Maria Lucia R. Santos succeeded in acquiring the school’s independence funded by the Local gov’t. Moreover, S.Y. 1992-1993 presented the school with 2615 enrollees, 2435 promotion candidates, and 334 graduates. And, in the course of the year 1992, Pimentel Bldg. was added to the school’s growing beauty. The newly built building was 2-storey with 4 rooms – 2 canteens, 1 academic classroom and 1 MAPEH faculty. The cost was 3,462,840.00 funded by the National Fund.

            Another leader who steered Las Pinas East National High School to further success in fulfilling its role to the community came in 1993 and supervised the school up to School Year 1998 – 1999. She is Ms. Andrelina J. Villanueva. This woman of essence made things even go smoother. During the S.Y. 1993-1994, there were already 3133 enrollees, 3090 for promotion, and 586 graduates. The numbers increased as years passed. S.Y. 1995-1996 with 4746 enrollees; S.Y. 1997-1998 with 4964 enrollees, 3959 promotion candidates, and 943 graduate students.

            Infrastructures were also made during Ms. Villanueva’s supervision. Such were the completion of SEDP 1 Bldg. and SEDP 2 Bldg. in 1993. SEDP 2 is a 2-storey bldg. with 5 rooms – 1 Science faculty room, 1 laboratory, and 3 acad. Rooms. Meanwhile, SEDP 1 is also a 2-storey bldg. but with only 4 rooms – 1 guidance office, 1 H.E. room, 1 Filipino faculty room, and 1 library. During the year 1996, Aguilar bldg. was born. It is an impressive 3-storey bldg. with 15 rooms – 1 Principal office, ½ for the Accounting and the other half for the clinic. 1 computer room and 12 academic classrooms. The total costs of  infrastructures in 1993 was 8,177,800.00 while in 1996 it reached 113, 801, 150.00 – the former funded by the National Funds while the latter by the Local fund. In 1997, after bravely tackling all hurdles, the Department of Education recognized the school’s accomplishments and was given the National status.

            Another woman yet again held the role of being the ship’s captain so to say. Dr. Maria Luisa Santos determinedly faced the challenge of leaving a bequest in her wake. She handled the school from S.Y. 1999- 2000 to S.Y. 2001 – 2002. The number of enrollees in her first year of supervision reached 4904, 4058 for promotion and 853 graduates. In the course of the S.Y. 2000-2001, there were already 5470 enrollees, 4283 for promotion, and 968 graduation studes. In the year 2001-2002, there were 6470 enrollees, 4302 promotion candidates and 889 graduates.

            Following Dr. Santos was Mrs. Eugenia V. Guerra who managed the school for 6 School years, from S.Y. 2002-2003 up to S.Y. 2007 – 2008. The number of enrollees in her first year of supervision reached 6165, 4936 for promotion and 924 graduates. In the course of the S.Y. 2003-2004, there were already 5628 enrollees, 4811 for promotion, and 1042 graduation studes. In the year 2004-2005, there were 5401 enrollees, 5213 promotion candidates and 1088 graduates. The number of enrollees during S.Y. 2005-2006 reached 4320, 4303 for promotion and 1088 graduates; S.Y. 2006 – 2007 had 4205 enrollees, 3590 promotion candidates and 892 graduates; S.Y. 2007 – 2008 had 4361 enrollees, 3742 promotion candidates and 742 graduates; and during her last year, the number of enrollees reached 4843, 3955 for promotion, and 833 graduates. In terms of infrastructures Mrs. Guerra also handled everything effectively. In 2006, in fact, the New Bldg. was built. It is a 2-storey bldg. with 2 rooms – ½ T.L.E Faculty, ½ Social Studies faculty, and 1 academic classroom. Moreover in 2007, the Principal Led was constructed. This infrastructure is described as a 3-storey bldg. with 2 rooms – 1 faculty (Values, English, and Mathematics) and 1 Demonstration Room.

            And now, Las Pinas East National High School has tackled all endeavors and brought all the lessons with its every trod. Presently, Las Pinas East National High School is managed by Ms. Phondora S. Capistrano and is continually growing under her guidance. As of the S.Y. 2009 – 2010 there were already 4830 enrollees. Las Pinas East National High School is really guided by its vision in accomplishing its mission. Up to now, it remains faithful to its calling – providing quality education and the best student training to produce globally competent students that our society will be proud of.
